# BluetoothApp
This app is for my Fall 2019 Senior Design Project. This app connects through bluetooth to a specific ESP32-PICO. The esp controls a device to assist individuals with narcolepsy. It then sends settings to the device. The code for the device can be found here: https://github.com/BrandonOng22/Narcolepsy_Device

The following settings are modifiable by this app:
- Sound Enabled
- Lights Enabled
- Interval Length (How long the timer is)
- Frequency of buzzer

## How to get the app
I am new to iOS programming and do not have the certifications required to upload to the App Store. Therefore, we need to get the app directly from the code. Since you can only program iOS using Apple products, a computer with iOS is required to get the app. 

Additionally, this app is designed for iOS 13 as the oldest version. So you iPhone must be running at least iOS 13.

Below are the steps:
- Get Xode on your computer. Xcode can be found in the App Store
- Open github on you iOS computer
- Select clone or download, then click Open in Xcode
- Once Xcode is open, click where it says No Scheme and choose New Scheme
- Connect your iPhone through the lightning cord to the computer
- Set the active scheme to your iPhone
- Press the play button and the app will upload onto your iPhone
